# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- **admin/routes.ts** — `POST /set-lore` now properly rejects empty, null, whitespace-only, and non-string keys (e.g. numbers, arrays) with a 400 response. Previously, non-string values slipped through to KV, potentially creating garbage entries with empty keys. The validation now uses `typeof` checks and a shared `extractKey()` helper used by all admin routes. (Issue #1)

- **admin/routes.ts** — `extractText()` now trims whitespace, so whitespace-only text values are rejected with 400 instead of being stored.

### Changed

- **admin/routes.ts** — Extracted shared `extractKey()`, `extractText()`, `extractSecret()`, and `checkSecret()` helpers to eliminate copy-paste drift across `set-lore`, `delete-lore`, and `gc` routes. Auth checks now flow through a single `checkSecret()` function. (Issue #1)
